            Physical address where the Kernel and drivers data (including BSS) will be stored in RAM.
            If the kernel is meant to be executed from RAM, this value must be checked to avoid overlapping with kernel code!

    config ROMDISK_ADDRESS
        hex "ROMDISK image physical address"
        default 0x8000
        range 0x4000 0x3C000
        depends on TARGET_ZEAL_8_BIT
        help
            Address where the ROMDISK image will be placed in flash memory. As flash is mapped at physical address 0x0000,
            this value also represents the physical address of ROMDISK image.
