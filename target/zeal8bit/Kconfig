    config KERNEL_RAM_PHYS_ADDRESS
        hex "Kernel RAM physical address"
        default 0x88000
        range 0x80000 0xFC000
        help
            Physical address where the Kernel and drivers data (including BSS) will be stored in RAM.
            If the kernel is meant to be executed from RAM, this value must be checked to avoid overlapping with kernel code!

    config ROMDISK_ADDRESS
        hex "ROMDISK image physical address"
        default 0x8000
        range 0x4000 0x3C000
        help
            Address where the ROMDISK image will be placed in flash memory. As flash is mapped at physical address 0x0000,
            this value also represents the physical address of ROMDISK image.

    config TARGET_ENABLE_VIDEO
        bool
        prompt "Enable video driver"
        default "y"
        help
            Import the video driver in the kernel compilation. If this option is disabled, the UART will become the default
            standard output.

    choice TARGET_STDOUT
        prompt "Standard output driver"
        default TARGET_STDOUT_VIDEO if TARGET_ENABLE_VIDEO
        default TARGET_STDOUT_UART if !TARGET_ENABLE_VIDEO
        help
            Choose the which driver will act as the standard output.

        config TARGET_STDOUT_VIDEO
            bool
            prompt "Video driver"
            depends on TARGET_ENABLE_VIDEO
            help
                Use the (FPGA-based) video board as the standard output.

        config TARGET_STDOUT_UART
            bool
            prompt "UART driver"
            help
                Use the UART driver as the standard output.
