        config KERNEL_REPRODUCIBLE_BUILD
                bool "Generate a reproducible binary"
                default n
                help
                        When this option is enabled, compiling the project several times with
                        the same configuration will produce the exact same binary. Thus, information
                        like build time will be excluded from the binary.

        config KERNEL_STACK_ADDR
                hex "Kernel Stack virtual address"
                default 0xFFFF
                range 0x0000 0xFFFF
                help
                        After initializing the MMU, the kernel will set the Stack Pointer (SP).
                        This value defines the top of the stack in the virtual memory.
                        This address must point to RAM.

        config KERNEL_COLDBOOT_HOOK
                bool "Hook routine at coldboot"
                default n
                help
                        When enabled, the kernel will call the routine named `target_coldboot` right
                        after initializing the MMU (if any) and setting up the stack.
                        This routine must be defined in the target code.

        config KERNEL_EXIT_HOOK
            bool "Hook routine at program exit"
            default n
            help
                        When enabled, the kernel will call the routine named `target_exit` right
                        after exiting a user program.
                        This routine must be defined in the target code.

        config KERNEL_MAX_LOADED_DRIVERS
                int "Maximum number of loaded drivers"
                default 16
                range 0 255
                help
                        Maximum number of drivers that can be loaded into the kernel.
                        This is valid for both loaded drivers at compile time and at runtime.
                        Must be a power of 2.

        config KERNEL_MAX_OPENED_DEVICES
                int "Maximum number of opened devices"
                default 16
                range 16 128
                help
                        Maximum number of opened devices for a program. This includes opened
                        drivers as well as opened files.

        config KERNEL_MAX_OPENED_FILES
                int "Maximum number of opened files"
                default 16
                range 16 128
                help
                        Maximum number of opened files at once. This only does not include opened
                        drivers.

        config KERNEL_PATH_MAX
                int "Maximum path length (files/directories)"
                default 128
                range 64 4096
                help
                        Maximum length of a single absolute file path. Incrementing this value will make
                        the kernel use more RAM.

        config KERNEL_INIT_EXECUTABLE
                string "Executable to launch on boot"
                default "A:/init.bin"
                help
                        Executable to load and execute on after system boot

                help
                        After the kernel has finished initializing all its components and its drivers,
                        it will load the KERNEL_INIT_EXECUTABLE in RAM. This constant defines the virtual
                        address where it will be loaded and executed from.

        config KERNEL_LOG_SUPPORT_ANSI_COLOR
                bool "Mark whether Kernel logger can use ANSI escape sequences for printing colors"
                default y
                help
                        Kernel logger, by default, prints logs without any color. However, if this option
                        is enable, it will be able to print error messages in red, warning messages in yellow
                        and info messages in green.
