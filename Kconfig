        Physical address where the Kernel and drivers data (including BSS) will be stored in RAM.
        If the kernel is meant to be executed from RAM, this value must be checked to avoid overlapping with kernel code!

        Address where the ROMDISK image will be placed in flash memory. As flash is mapped at physical address 0x0000,
        this value also represents the physical address of ROMDISK image.
